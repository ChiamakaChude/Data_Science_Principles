Ecoli Dataset Classification <br>
This project involves classifying the Ecoli dataset using two different machine learning models: Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. The dataset consists of 129 samples with 5 features and a binary class label indicating the location of proteins.

Key Steps:
Data Loading and Exploration:

Loaded the Ecoli dataset.
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution.
Data Preprocessing:

Randomized the dataset to ensure balanced representation.
Split the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.
Model Implementation:

Applied Gaussian Naive Bayes, suitable for continuous features.
Implemented Logistic Regression, optimized using Maximum Likelihood Estimation.


Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy
F1 Score
ROC-AUC
