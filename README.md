Ecoli Dataset Classification <br>
This project involves classifying the Ecoli dataset using two different machine learning models: Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. The dataset consists of 129 samples with 5 features and a binary class label indicating the location of proteins.<br>

Key Steps:<br>
Data Loading and Exploration:<br>
Loaded the Ecoli dataset.
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution.<br><br>
Data Preprocessing:
Randomized the dataset to ensure balanced representation.
Split the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.<br><br>
Model Implementation:
Applied Gaussian Naive Bayes, suitable for continuous features.
Implemented Logistic Regression, optimized using Maximum Likelihood Estimation.<br><br>


Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy<br>
F1 Score<br>
ROC-AUC<br><br>
